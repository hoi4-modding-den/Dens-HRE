You have two methods of impacting the policy stances of the empire as a whole; lobbying and dictating. The latter is an action that only the current emperor can perform at the cost of 100 political power, which immediatly sways the scales towards which ever policy stance they ended up choosing. Lobbying, on the other hand, is something that every member state can do, at the cost of 20 political power. You are allowed to lobby for the same policies multiple times. In order for it to have an effect in the grand scale of things, the desired policy stance must be lobbied at least five times. You can check the current amount of lobbying towards each policy stance by hovering your mouse over their icons. In the event that the intensity of the lobbying exceeds 5, the scales shall be tipped towards the lobbied policy stance."
