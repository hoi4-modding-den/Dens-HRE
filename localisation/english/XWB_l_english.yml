 XWB_king_idea_desc:0 "King Albrecht Maria Alexander Philipp Joseph of Württemberg is the current monarch of the Kingdom of Württemberg. He succeeded to the throne on October 2nd, 1921, when King Wilhelm II of Württemberg died without a son, ending the Urach line of the House of Württemberg and leaving Württemberg in the hands of the 200-years-removed Ducal line of the family. Having fought as the Oberbefehlshaber of the Army in the Great Rhine War, Albrecht of Württemberg has governed much the same as his predecessor, generally leaving the governing of the kingdom up to the Prime Ministers in his advanced age, even as the electoral process has given way to far-right corporate interests. While he is not happy about the current administration, there is not much that can be done given his age. The Porsche administration may find itself on the backfoot if the king ever takes a more active stance in politics, but for now the status quo remains."
