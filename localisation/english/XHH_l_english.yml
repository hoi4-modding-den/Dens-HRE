# EVENTS
 XHH_internal_events.1.t: "Aufhebung des Bremer Freistadtsgesetzes!"
 XHH_internal_events.1.desc: "In the last few months, the administration has rolled back most of the protections granting the Hanseatic city of Bremen additional autonomy in regards to their economic planning. While the Bremer Senat is outraged over this blatant act of centralisation, the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] has commented on it as erasing special priviliges granted by the previous Kurfürst."
 XHH_internal_events.1.a: "No more exceptions!"
 XHH_internal_events.2.t: "Meeting with Ältermann Bugge"
 XHH_internal_events.2.desc: "The Ältermann of the Kontor of Hamburg, Josef Bugge, had been representing Hanse interests in the Hamburger Senat for the last thirty years. However, new anti-corruption laws now stipulate that members of the Senate cannot also be members of corporate entities, to avoid any conflicts of interest.\n \nIn a bid to maintain good favour with the Hanse, the Senate has now decided to make exceptions with members of the Hanse, even if it will basically negate any impact the law would have made and only serves to further increase Hanse dominance over the economy."
 XHH_internal_events.2.a: "That could have gone better."
 XHH_internal_events.3.t: "Kurfürst Tom opens the 150th Session of the Hamburg Senate"
 XHH_internal_events.3.desc: "The Senate of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg has existed since the 12th century, representing the interests of the citizenry. With the expansion of Hamburg to mean the territories of Schleswig, Holstein, Hannover, Bremen and Mecklenburg, the senate has taken the form of a national parliament for the principality.\n \nDespite its earlier forms not being dependent on the nobility, with the declaration of the Principality of Hamburg, the Kurfürst of Hamburg and its Dependencies has gained significant influence, now basically dictating the senate's acts and enjoying an almost unlimited veto right."
 XHH_internal_events.3.a: "To another successful year!"
 XHH_internal_events.4.t: "Strikes!"
 XHH_internal_events.4.desc: "Despite our efforts to weaken the Labour Union institutions, workers have begun striking."

 XHH_internal_events.5.t: "The Catholic Minority"
 XHH_internal_events.5.desc: "While the majority of our population is Protestant, there is a vocal Catholic majority that demands of us that we recognise the Holy See and [XRO.GetNameDef]."

 XHH_internal_events.5.b: "Who cares about an old man in Rome?"
 XHH_internal_events.6.t: "[GetYear] Hamburger Elections!"
 XHH_internal_events.6.desc: "It is once again election time in [ROOT.GetNameDef]!"
 XHH_internal_events.6.a: "Victory for Lüdemann and the SPD!"
 XHH_internal_events.6.b: "Klinghoffer's USPD wins!"
 XHH_internal_events.6.c: "Seitz and the Liberals get the mandate!"
 XHH_internal_events.6.d: "The people elect Kluck!"
 XHH_internal_events.7.t: "Victory in the Baltic Sea Dispute!"
 XHH_internal_events.7.desc: "Our rivalry with [XFT.GetNameDef] has finally come to an end with our army seizing control over the ports of $VICTORY_POINTS_6282$, $VICTORY_POINTS_11372$ and $VICTORY_POINTS_362$, effectively separating them from the sea."

 XHH_internal_events.8.t: "Order restored in $STATE_85$"
 XHH_internal_events.8.desc: "Following a state of unrest in the newly-integrated Hanseatic city of Danzig, troops have been deployed to quell the chaos. Danzig has now been secured and its civil administration has been fully integrated."

 XHH_internal_events.10.b: "Arrest them!"
 XHH_internal_events.11.t: "Dealing with the Opposition"
 XHH_internal_events.11.desc: "The Democrats and Monarchists in the administration have been opposing our moves to seize more power and enact our reforms, therefore they must go."

 XHH_diplo_events.5.desc: "Representatives from [FROM.GetNameDef] have approached us with the proposal of having us lease some dockyard facilities to their navy in exchange for industrial investments."

 XHH_news_events.1.t: "Hamburg restricts Princely Powers"
 XHH_news_events.1.desc: "In a constitutional referendum, the senate of Hamburg has voted to revoke the veto powers of the Kurfürst of Hamburg. This, in addition with other acts reducing the Kurfürst's influence in politics, have essentially made [FROM.GetLeader] into a figurehead.\n \nWhile the Kurfürst will still be up for election within the Empire, he will most likely only be a representative of the senate and the people of Hamburg."
 XHH_news_events.1.a: "What a shame that it has come to this."
 XHH_news_events.1.b: "A step into the future."
 XHH_news_events.1.c: "Democracy will never work."
 XHH_news_events.2.t: "[ROOT.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] recognises the Papal States"
 XHH_news_events.2.desc: "In an unexpected move, the Kurfürst Tom I. has called for the Senate of Hamburg to recognise the independence of [XRO.GetNameDef]. To this day, [XRO.GetNameDef] had not been recognised as a country due to fears of upsetting the Protestant majority within the nation. However, the Kurfürst seems to expect to be able to curry favours with the other Prince-Electors of the Holy Roman Empire and the Pope by recognising [XRO.GetNameDef].\n \nThe Protestant nationalists in [ROOT.GetNameDef] have already denounced the actions of the Kurfürst and it seems unlikely that they will continue cooperation with the conservative party inside the Senate."
 XHH_news_events.2.a: "A victory for Catholicism."

 XHH_news_events.3.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] annexes Wilhelmshaven"
