# EVENTS
 XHH_internal_events.1.t: "Aufhebung des Bremer Freistadtsgesetzes!"
 XHH_internal_events.1.desc: "In the last few months, the administration has rolled back most of the protections granting the Hanseatic city of Bremen additional autonomy in regards to their economic planning. While the Bremer Senat is outraged over this blatant act of centralisation, the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] has commented on it as erasing special priviliges granted by the previous Kurfürst."
 XHH_internal_events.1.a: "No more exceptions!"
 XHH_internal_events.2.t: "Meeting with Ältermann Bugge"
 XHH_internal_events.2.desc: "The Ältermann of the Kontor of Hamburg, Josef Bugge, had been representing Hanse interests in the Hamburger Senat for the last thirty years. However, new anti-corruption laws now stipulate that members of the Senate cannot also be members of corporate entities, to avoid any conflicts of interest.\n \nIn a bid to maintain good favour with the Hanse, the Senate has now decided to make exceptions with members of the Hanse, even if it will basically negate any impact the law would have made and only serves to further increase Hanse dominance over the economy."
 XHH_internal_events.2.a: "That could have gone better."
 XHH_internal_events.3.t: "Kurfürst Tom opens the 150th Session of the Hamburg Senate"
 XHH_internal_events.3.desc: "The Senate of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg has existed since the 12th century, representing the interests of the citizenry. With the expansion of Hamburg to mean the territories of Schleswig, Holstein, Hannover, Bremen and Mecklenburg, the senate has taken the form of a national parliament for the principality.\n \nDespite its earlier forms not being dependent on the nobility, with the declaration of the Principality of Hamburg, the Kurfürst of Hamburg and its Dependencies has gained significant influence, now basically dictating the senate's acts and enjoying an almost unlimited veto right."
 XHH_internal_events.3.a: "To another successful year!"
 XHH_internal_events.4.t: "Strikes!"
 XHH_internal_events.4.desc: "Despite our efforts to weaken the Labour Union institutions, workers have begun striking."
 XHH_internal_events.4.a: "Damn."
 XHH_internal_events.5.t: "The Catholic Minority"
 XHH_internal_events.5.desc: "While the majority of our population is Protestant, there is a vocal Catholic majority that demands of us that we recognise the Holy See and [XRO.GetNameDef]."
 XHH_internal_events.5.a: "We must recognise the Holy See."
 XHH_internal_events.5.b: "Who cares about an old man in Rome?"
